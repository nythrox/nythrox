## What I'm up to
- 🌎 I’m working on many different libraries! 
   - I'm trying to improve the typescript functional programming ecosystem 
   - Discovering how to better apply DDD principles, Tagless Final, Free Monads, and zio-style in typescript
- 🌱 I’m also learning Clojure!

## How about you?
- 🤔 I’m looking for help on Functional Programming! I'd love to understand how you architect your systems using FP, and what tradeoffs you choose to go with.
- 👯 I’m interested in collaborating on projects that help bring decentralization to the internet!
- 💬 Talk to me about Typescript! I believe in the future of typescript: custom transformers, statically typed dynamic programs, powerful type libraries!

## Values
- 🌊 Clean code is the way to go! Creating maintainable software is just as important as launching new features 🚢
- ️‍🔥 I care deeply about making products that can change the world! ⚙️️‍
- 🏴 I believe in Open Source, decentralization, self-empowerment, mutual cooperation, and sustainability 🏳️‍🌈
