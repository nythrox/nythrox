## What I'm up to
- 🌎 I’m working on many different libraries! 
   - I'm learning more about Algebraic Effects, and creating an implementation in Typescript 
   - I'm discovering how to better apply DDD principles, Tagless Final, Free Monads, and zio-style in typescript
- 🌱 I’m also learning Scala!

## How about you?
- 🤔 I’m looking for help on Functional Programming! I'd love to understand how you architect your systems using FP, and what tradeoffs you choose to go with.
- 👯 I’m interested in collaborating on projects that help bring decentralization to the internet!
- 💬 Talk to me about Typescript! I like thinking about the future of typescript: custom transformers, static analysers, powerful type libraries!
