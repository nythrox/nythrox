### Hi! 👋
##### I'm Jason, a full-stack developer with interests in everything tech-related, and more!

- 🌎 I’m currently working on many different libraries! 
   - I'm trying to improve the typescript FP ecosystem, 
   - I'm discovering how to better apply DDD principles, Tagless Final, Free Monads, and zio-style in typescript
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Clojure!
- 👯 I’m interested in collaborating on projects that help bring back decentralization to the internet
- 🏴 Open Source, decentralization, community, cooperation, self-empowerment, and autonomy 🏳️‍🌈
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Functional Programming! I'd love to understand how you architect your systems, and how FP has changed the way you program
- 💬 Ask me about Typescript! I believe in the future of typescript: custom transformers, statically typed dynamic programs, powerful type libraries! And I love to talk about it 😃
- 📫 How to reach me: 
   - Reach me on telegram @nythrox
